This is my attempt to create weather app mostly myself. You can enter city name, then first API will request conversion of city name into latitude and longitude, that are then used to get weather data for these specific coordinates.

In order for this code to work you need to enter your API key from openweathermap.org (It's free, don't recommend it tho)

WMO codes and corresponding images of weather were taken from here -> https://gist.github.com/stellasphere/9490c195ed2b53c707087c8c2db4ec0c
I took API that I used to convert city name into latitude and longitude from here: openweathermap.org
I took API that I used to find weather data from here: open-meteo.com
